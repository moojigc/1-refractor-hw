# Refractoring of Horiseon's home page

In this refractor, I have switched out div tags for semantic HTML5 tags, removed unnecessary code,  restructured both the HTML and CSS for readability and future ease of collaboration, and added alt tags to the images for better accessibility and improved SEO.
